### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS media queries to make the layout responsive across different screen sizes.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    body {
        padding: 0;
    }
    .container {
        border-radius: 0;
    }
    .omelette-img {
        padding: 0;
    }
    .omelette-img > img {
        border-radius: 0;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for writing media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_media.php) - This is an amazing resource which helped me finally understand CSS @media rule. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
